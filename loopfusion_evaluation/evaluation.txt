loop fusion evaluation:
- VC: Vertex in Cell, 20 time steps only
- GS: Gray Scott
- LJ: Lennard Jones
- improve: improved version of the solutions above
- master: base version of the solutions above
- comparing realtime only
- using ./m.sh for creating measurements of one setup

execution order: from left to right and from top to bottom
1. improve1: VC;LJ;GS
2. master1: VC;LJ;GS
3. improve2: VC;LJ;GS
4. master2: VC;LJ;GS
5. GS: improve3;master3
6. LJ: improve3;master3
7. VC: improve3;master3

GS master3 1m19.986s .. 1m22.442s (~1m21.376s)

observation: first measurements of each solution seem to be outliers
 - probably due do cache misses

total aggregated execution times excluding outliers:
VC master: 5m33.750s
VC improve: 5m31.938s
LJ master: 0m12.785s
LJ improve: 0m12.689s
GS master: 1m22.671s
GS improve: 1m13.249s

observation: loop fusion reduces simulation execution times
- VC: - ~2s
- LJ: - ~100ms
- GS: - ~10s
